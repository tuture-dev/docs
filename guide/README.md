# Introduction

Tuture is the solution attempting to accelerate the dissemination of IT knowledge and skills. It consists of two major components:

- **Toolchain to write tutorials**, namely [tuture](https://github.com/tutureproject/tuture) and [tuture-cli](https://github.com/tutureproject/cli), which can help you easily write juicy tech tutorials on your laptop.
- **Platform to share tutorials**, namely [tuture.co](https://tuture.co), where you can share or read tutorials from you and others

If you can't wait to get started with our tools and platforms, jump right into [installation](./installation.md).

## Game Changer of Technology Learning

Tuture is all about **text-based tutorials with real projects and application scenarios inside**.

Why this approach as the primary means of learning and spreading technologies? Let's compare the other ways.

**Videos**

As a continuation of the classroom, video is a relatively more cognition-friendly way that many people choose to learn something new. But video as a learning medium itself has the following drawbacks:

- Difficult to systematically display knowledge systems
- Inconvenient to retrieve or target desired knowledge
- Impossible to fully adapt to learning paces of everyone

The time-consuming and arduous job of producing video tutorials plus demanding requirements of the author bring about more limitations:

- Typically charge quite a lot
- Updates are far from timely to react to rapid changes in our field
- The total amount of video tutorials is not large enough to cover all aspects of each technology

Tutorials on Tuture, however, are **totally free**, and due to the ease of writing and the short production cycle, the number and speed of output tutorials greatly outperform videos.

**Books**

Books are one of the most time-honored and most important mediums for inheriting human civilization, and of course they apply to the spread of IT technology, but following shortcomings (many are similar to video) demote them from the best choice:

- Learning period is generally very long and not suited for fast-paced learning and practice.
- Unable to keep up with the ever-changing IT field
- Qualities of books vary a lot, with bad ones infiltrated with mistakes not in the minority
- Interaction and communication between the author and readers is quite limited

Most tutorials on [Tuture](https://tuture.co) **only take roughly ten minutes to complete**. Premium tutorials are carefully curated.  You can explore on your own as well. Freedom of choice. More interestingly, you can easily communicate with the author of the tutorial or other learners.

**Official Documentation**

Official documentation is widely recognized as one of the most important resources by virtue of its authority and timeliness, and some do serve as outstanding learning materials. However, most of the documents are written in English, which poses language barriers for many non-native English speakers.

On the other hand, it focuses too much on **explaining concepts and listing APIs**, which means it's ideal for reference but not perfect for learning. But with hands-on tutorials on Tuture, you can **build a real project** and quickly master the essence of technologies in practical applications.

**Tech Blogs**

The explosion of technology blogs has been around for many years, and geeks around the globe have shared myriad of tech blog posts. Just enter what we want to learn in the search engine and an endless list of tutorials are awaiting us.

Tuture originated from conventional tech blogs but is committed to solving some fundamental problems:

- Writing blog posts has too many degrees of freedom, leading to great variance of qualities of tutorials, while Tuture tries to enforce a standard way of writing tutorials (see [Start Writing](./start-writing.md)) based on commits of real Git repositories to ensure the practicality
- Superior posts are scattered all over the Internet, and it’s impossible to get them all, while Tuture tries to provide a platform that brings them together so that people don’t have to look around any more
- Interaction is very limited (generally only comments), while Tuture tries to provide a convenient and powerful community to bring authors and readers closer.

## Revolution of Writing Experience

Tuture has revolutionized the way in which tech tutorials are written.

- **Generated directly from a live codebase**: Your tutorial will be a faithful mirror of your code. Just start from a Git repo, build something interesting with nicely-written commit messages, and Tuture will bring all the good things to your tutorial. Your codebase will grow as more inspiration come in, so will your tutorial.
- **Automatic extraction of code diff**: One of the greatest pain point of writing tutorials is the daunting manual work of collecting code snippets of each changed file for each step. Fortunately, Tuture will handle this boring and error-prone work for you, so you can just focus on writing amazing tuturials.
- **Edit tutorials alongside your code**: It can be much clearer and easier to write something just next to your code. With full-fleged markdown support and a series of handy tools, writing high-quality tech posts has never been this fun.
- **Share your work in a breeze**: Sharing is one of the time-honored conventions within the geek community, which is fully valued and appreciated by Tuture. Fortunately, publishing your tutorials is just one command away (`tuture publish` and you are done). Come and visit [tuture.co](https://tuture.co) for tutorials written by you and others!

## Words on "Learn By Doing"

Learn by doing is a popular learning model, and [Manning Press](https://www.manning.com/) has published a series of *XXX in Action* books (such as *Machine Learning in Action*, etc.), which is also the central tenet of Tuture's faith.

Computer science is by all means a highly practical subject. Learning by rote is not only inefficient, but will also gradually strip your interest and motivation to move forward. Unfortunately, today's learning resources generally do not provide the ideal way of practice, and most of them focus on the list of concepts, making many beginners daunting.

Tuture encourages you to participate in real world projects by learning in practice to get the most grounded knowledge and experience quickly and grasp the charm of the industry. Last but not least, the sense of accomplishment that comes along is invaluable.
